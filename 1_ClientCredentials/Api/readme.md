# Quickstart #1.2: Setup Api application in VS 2019

The doc and code here is derived from the tutorial [Client Credentials](http://docs.identityserver.io/en/latest/quickstarts/1_client_credentials.html). But I removed some unnecessary code and tried it on Visual Studio 2019.

For quick trying and experience, you can download the Git code and run it. But if you want to set up the project from scratch, here is the step by step guide.

## Step by step

The following doc is to show how to create the Api project in Visual Studio 2019.

### Create project

Firstly, let's create a new project in VS 2019. As project should be included in a solution, you can add the new project into an empty solution, or an existing one.


So far the project is created. Then we will configure it and add code.

### Install package


### Code change


### Launch settings


### Start project and check URL
